# IoT_FoodSafety
NMSU CAPSTONE PROJECT

Background

The increasing demand of food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has raised the need for intensification and industrialization of the food and agricultural sector. Internet of Things (IoT) is a highly promising family of technology capable of offering many solutions towards the smart farming, precision agriculture, revolutionary supply chain management. Moreover, to solve challenges like resource efficiency, disease and risk management, it is important for the food, farming, and meat production sector to stay on top of their production process, monitoring and if needed controlling every part of it. Brining IoT to the food and agricultural sector can help achieve this goal. In this project, students will design the system that comprises data capturing and decision-making functionalities that are built on top of an implementation of IoT.

Summary

Students will design an Internet of Things platform that will support applications that could be used by farmers, retailers, the government, analysts and consumers.
